## Bergey Lab Guidelines and Tips
Besides the rules for your program and university, here are a few guidelines and tips for the lab.

### Major points:
1. **Don’t be a jerk.**
- Working with good people on interesting problems is what makes all the other headache worthwhile. Strive to be collegial and collaborative.
2. **Foster an inclusive environment.**
- Diversity is a boon for our research group, for science, and for society. Our lab values diversity of background and experience, including race/ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, and having disabilities. As a corollary to Rule #1, we work to create an environment where all lab members can participate in doing science.
- Systemic racism and colonialism pervade our disciplines (be they evolutionary biology, genetics, anthropology, or public health.) To begin to correct these injustices, we have an additional obligation as scientists to take anti-racist actions. Here are some starter readings if you are interested in learning more:

  - [UW Genomics Salon's Toolkit on Race, Ethics, and Justice in Genetics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PucJEKE4I-joU_aTayxBcCzR5wbodhas7xFlJQ49clM/edit)
3. **Your life is more than science.**
- Nothing we do is so vital that protracted suffering is warranted. Take breaks, cultivate hobbies, and spend time with people you like.
4. **Good communication will forestall most problems.**
- Many conflicts and worries can be solved with an open dialogue.
- Science is a human endeavor so mistakes are made and software bugs persist and email replies are forgotten. Don’t hide problems (or hide in general.) I can lend a hand or at least commiserate. 
5. **Be rigorous and persistent in your science.**
- Estimates of how long a project will take are often off by an order of magnitude. Choose projects and set up your work life in a way that lets you push for the long haul. If you feel as though you’ve lost enthusiasm for the work or a project, we should discuss and troubleshoot and potentially shift our trajectory.
- Never compromise your integrity for a _p_-value.
- Be sure to take time to invest in building skills (_e.g._, learning a new programming language, reading the literature) that will pay compound dividends in the future, but which might not seem urgent.

### Less major points:

6. **Backup:** Have a robust and redundant backup system for your data and scripts. Check it works before you need to use it.
7. **Reproducibility:** Release data and software (i.e., in a GitHub repository), and invest time in documentation. This way, other people can build on what you do. Realize that "other people" may very well include you in 6 months’ or 6 years’ time.
8. **Presenteeism:** I do not care what hours of the day you work. One of the great perks of academia is that if you wake up on a Thursday morning and feel like not working, you can often just not work. I should note, if I email you at a goofy hour, I do not expect an immediate response.
9. **Deadlines:** For drafts of abstracts, manuscripts, grant applications, etc., give me some heads up before the due date and enough time to be able to provide solid edits. Same goes for letters of recommendation.
10. **Ownership:** You will be the main shepherd (midwife? captain?) for your project(s), and you should endeavor to make steady progress for the good of your (and my) career and sanity. When in the analytical weeds, don’t neglect poking your head up to read the relevant literature. (Drafting sections of the paper as you progress with analyses is the mark of a scientist who has their life together.) Though made up of people at different career stages, the lab strives to be egalitarian. Collaborations should benefit and be worthwhile to all parties. Run collaborations by me, especially ones with folks not in the lab.
